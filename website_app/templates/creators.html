            <p>This is the website for our CS 222 project. Our goal was to analyze data collected from Twitter and
                display this
                data on a graph. The first step in this process was scraping data from Twitter. This data was cleaned
                and
                analyzed using sentiment analysis. The two key attributes that we took from this analysis was polarity
                and
                subjectivity. The polarity measures how "positive" or "negative" a text is in terms of how it reads.
                Finally, a
                graph will be generated from the final results! All of the code for collecting, cleaning, and analyzing
                our data
                was in python. We hope to be able to make an interactive graph available to view at the end. An
                important note
                is that this is the lite version of our actual program, only taking a max of 300 tweets as data since
                data
                collection can take hours. Graphs generated from our large datasets should be available to view
                separately. </p>
